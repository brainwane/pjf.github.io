### Commercial versus community-run

Conferences can broadly be divided into two types: those which are run for-profit, and those which are run by the community. Commercial conferences typically have higher ticket prices, bigger advertising budgets, and more money to splash around. Unfortunately they're also the ones that are most likely to disappoint. It's easy to feel that everything is being done to turn a profit, that there are endless "sponsored talks", and that the programme selection is based upon what will make the most sales as opposed to any sort of community involement.

In my experience, community-driven conferences are usually much, much better than their commercial counterparts. They're focused on the experience of attendees and speakers, and on the betterment of their community. The people running the events are generally doing so because they're passionate about them, not because it's their job. Having someone who gives a damn goes a long way to having a conference that's worth attending.

There's also an in-between state with for-profit conferences that are run by a very small and dedicated team. Having run a conference before, I have a *lot* of sympathy for these teams. Running the event is not their every-day job, and they're often doing it because they're passionate about their field. However unlike community-run conferences they don't really get to pass the event on to a new team every year, which can make it very, very hard for them to take a break.

In general, the fewer people being paid to run a conference, the more patience I have with them. 

### Get a speaker manager

Speaker management makes a big difference as to whether or not I'll re-apply to a conference. I've had conferences where the speaker management has been truly awful; either I've had to send endless reminder emails and follow-ups to try and get basic questions answered, or the conference has been so interruptive and inconsistent it's resulted in an almost endless stream of asking speakers to do things, and then correcting those emails.

I've quietly declined to re-apply to conferences where the speaker management has been particularly bad, because the last thing I need in addition to travel and talk-writing stress is to have administrative pain on top of it.

I've worked with both good and bad speaker managers, both in being a speaker and coordinating speakers, and a good manager makes an *incredible* difference to the experience.

While not always the case, commercial conferences typically have *worse* speaker managers than community-run events. Speaker management in commercial conferences can sometimes feel like it's an afterthought.

### A word on speaker contracts

Most commercial conferences I've spoken at seem to have some sort of speaker contract. They can use my image in advertising, record the talk, yadda yadda. It's *totally reasonable* to have speaker contracts, they clarify things for everyone, and I don't mind them one bit.

What I mind is getting a speaker contract *a week before the conference*. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume that this is when your lawyers realised a contract should exist, but being asked to sign a contract *after* one has gone to the effort of making travel arrangements, writing a talk, and rearranging one's life to attend feels very, very slimy. The time to ask someone to sign a contract is *when you accept their talk*.

If you do send a contract late, be prepared for when speakers decline to sign it. You're trying to impose conditions on them well after everything has been agreed upon.

### Reimbursing speakers

I don't expect every conference to reimburse my travel and accommodation expenses, but I hold some pretty strong opinions on when they should.

If the conference is *for-profit*, then they're making money from my attendence, and covering my expenses is expected. The higher their per-ticket price for attendees, the bigger my frown if they claim they have no budget for speaker travel. Depending upon the circumstances I may or may not ask for a speaking fee as well.

If the conference is not for profit, then I'm *much* more understanding if they don't have a travel budget. A lot of not-for-profits have extremely affordable ticket prices; their goal is to make sure people can attend, and I wouldn't expect these conferences to have much to cover travel at all.

### Quiet rooms

At practically every conference I've been to, even single-day ones, there will be a point where things will get to be just a bit *too* much, and I'll lock myself in a bathroom stall so I can have a moment to relax and decompress. I know that I'm not the only conference participant to do this, nor am I the only high-profile speaker to do so. Which means I want to be clear to every conference organiser ever:

Your participants *need* a quiet room at your conference.

The speakers' lounge is *not* a quiet room.

The hackers' lounge is *not* a quiet room.

The reception / vendor's hall / local bar is definitely *not* a quiet room.

A quiet room is a place there the rule is you *must* be quiet. No speaking. No devices that make noise. Preferably not even keyboards, no matter how quiet the keys. It's a place where people can go to have a comfortable, low-stimulation, non-interactive environment.

I need a quiet room so that when the conference becomes overwhelming, I can decompress. But your quiet room is in service to people with migraines, or anxiety, or who are underslept, or just need to check their phone for a moment in quiet.

The best quiet rooms have subdued lighting, and preferably avoid fluroescent lights which can be terrible to people with migraines, whom I guarantee will be headed to the room.
