                <p><b>Linux.conf.au 2009</b><br>
I'm sitting on a pristine beach.  Nearby, a bee that's almost the
size of my thumb lazily makes its way between the fragrant violet
flowers on the tree that provides my shade.  The sun is warm,
but not too hot, and a few small sailing craft are out on the
water, enjoying the mild weather and light winds.  Beyond the
water a breathtaking range of mountains rise.  In the water,
a wetsuited man swims to a nearby moored boat, while nesting
gulls swoop him from overhead, and a flotilla of ducks cautiously
follow, hopeful for an easy meal.
<p>
You'd be excused to think that I was on holidays, but actually
I'm at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> (LCA), which this
year is being held in Hobart, Tasmania.  Tasmania has always been
known for its breathtaking landscapes, pristine wilderness, and
excellent beer.  Having spent the last week here, I can assure you
that Tasmania has all these things in abundance.
<p>
Like most conferences, one has to make a choice at LCA: talks,
social, sleep; pick two.  Since I fell into my usual bad habit of
working on my slides and presentations during the conference period,
I was really only able to pick one; in this case, I picked social.
<p>
This year I seem to be a lot more trendy than I'm used to, and this
was even before I gave my talks.  I've been invited to the exclusive
dinners, I was readily included in conversations with authors of
famous books and software, and there was a most touching moment where
one of the local University of Tasmania students told me that he
managed to get a number of registrations based purely upon my
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=525">lightning talk from last year</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jarich/journal">Jacinta</a> had the first talks for the conference, both of which
occurred on the Monday LinuxChix mini-conf.  Her talk
<i>On Speaking</i> had the audience in rapture and easily
rates as one of the best talks, if not <i>the</i> best talk I
saw at the entire conference.
<p>
For my talks, I had one scheduled presentation, and
<i>three</i> unscheduled ones, one of which was a lightning
talk.  The other two talks were due to a speaker giving notice
of a late cancellation, and I happened to have a few talks that
were ready to go.
<p>
For my fill-in talks, I gave my talk on
<a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/228"><i>The Art of Klingon Programming</i> and 
<i>What's New in Perl 5.10</i></a> (heavily revised from the
talk I gave before 5.10 was released).  Some vanity searching
revealed some excellent feedback with regards to these talk,
which I'm really happy with, because they weren't as polished
as I would have liked them to be.
<p>
My main talk was <a href="http://lca2009.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/175"><i>Awesome Things You've Missed in Perl</i></a>,
discussed a range of new Perl technologies, many of which have
only been written in the last two years.  My lightning talk was a small mention of <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack, a better grep</a>, which ended up winning one of the (three) awards for best lightning talk.  Next year I'm going to have to give a lightning talk on how to give good lightning talks.
<p>
The most newsworthy event (at least by local media standards) was
the Penguin Dinner.  As is the custom, we had a charity auction at dinner,
in this case to raise money for the <a href="http://www.tassiedevil.com.au/">Save The Tasmanian Devil foundation</a>.
Part-way through the bidding process, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdale_Garbee">Bdale Garbee</a> made a commitment
to shave his beard if the money raised was more than a certain
amount.  While I wasn't able to keep track of all the pledges and contributions, the result was a final amount of money raised that approached
the $40,000 AUD mark, and Bdale lost his beard.

<b>Memoirs of an OSCON Rockstar, Day 5</b>
<br>
This entry is about six months late.  The other entries I had written
on my flight back to Australia, whereas this one is being written back
on the ground.  It seems that the ground provides a great many distractions
and demands.
<p>
Friday was by far the most memorable day of OSCON 2008.  Firstly, I managed
to complete one of my lifetime goals of giving a plenary at OSCON.  Not only
did I have the entire OSCON audience to myself (which was <i>thousands</i>
of people), I was also giving the last talk for the entire conference,
and (at least for the conferences I go to), everyone expects the last
talk to be really good.
<p>
At this point I'm going to reveal one of the strange paradoxes of
public speaking.  The bigger your audience, and the higher their
expectations, <i>the easier it is</i>.  There's a whole bunch of
mental mechanic reasons why this is the case, but they're so long
they deserve a blog post of their own.
<p>
Before the talk I remember Edd being wonderful and finding me some food.
While I had spent lots of time on talk preparations, I'd forgotten to
find anything to eat during that time.  Thanks Edd!
<p>
The whole talk went smashingly well.  Everyone laughed at my jokes,
even the really cheesy ones.  I think it's sufficient to say it was
my most successful presentation ever.
<p>
After the talk I found the Perl crowd I'd been spending time with, and
went out for some very nice (and very cheap!) Vietnamese.  Skud suggested
I get a basil-seed drink, which was amazing, and I really need to put
my photo on-line to show it off properly.  Tim Bunce, hero of DBI and
NYTProf, passed his iPhone around the tables and collected everyone's
contact details.  If you need to contact anyone in the Perl world,
there's a good chance you can do so using Tim's phone.
<p>
Having finished our meal, there Perl crowd seemed to disperse.  Some
went home, I think some went to the Portland Beer Festival, and I
joined the group that went off to Powell's book store.  After a fun
time looking at books, I returned to Powell's cafe, where we generally
decided was our centrla meeting point.  I'd picked up a book on
the cultivation of wild fungi, and immediately made friends with
Stacy, a friend of Schwern's and a local to Portland, who was also
a mushroom hunter.  Apparently Portland has big crops of Chanterelles
each year, of which I'm intensely jealous.
<p>
At some point I get invited to a BBQ, and I secretly cheer inside, because
it would have been rather sad if I gave a massively successful talk in
front of thousands of people and didn't get invited to anything.  I
heartily accept.
<p>
There are some street-car (tram) trips, and Schwern offers me the loan
of a bike to get to the BBQ.  Having not had a chance to cycle anywhere
all week, I think this sounds like a fantastic way to get around.  Stacy
was kind enough to volunteer as a guide to get me to the BBQ.  I'm very
happy for this, because every time I turn a corner by myself I drift
onto the left hand side of the road, which is a great place for cyclists
to be in Australia, but definitely not a good place in America.
<p>
On the way to the BBQ we drop off at a store to buy some provisions to
take along.  Stacy introduces me to some delicious local cherries, and
then hits me with one of the most awkward moments of my entire trip:
"We should bring some wine to the party.  Since you're Australian,
can you pick out a nice Australian wine?"
<p>
As the cool international speaker, I don't know how to admit that I
actually know nothing about Australian wines.  Yes, I'm a great consumer
of them, but I have a huge circle of Australian friends who know their
wines <i>much</i> better than me, and I usually just take their advice.
Of the good wines that I <i>do</i> know, none of them are at the store,
so I kind of pick something at random.
<p>
With cherries and wine acquired, we continue onto the BBQ, where I
experience what is the singularly greatest moment I have ever had as
a conference speaker.  When I arrive, the host of the party, Lindsey 
(who I previously hadn't met), is <i>actively reciting part of my talk</i>.
I remember just standing there with a huge grin on my face until I'm
eventually introduced, when I discover that Lindsey is an awesomely
cool person, and one of the reasons for the BBQ is because Lindsey
is leaving Portland to continue her studies of Computer Science
(to the doctorate level, IIRC).  And then the best part of the
night happens, which fulfils a <i>second</i> lifetime goal...
<p>
I get to play Rock Band.  In a real basement.  On a <i>huge</i> projection
screen.  For bonus points, we even have Adam Kennedy on drums.
<p>
As strange as it sounds, playing <i>Rock Band</i> was one of my goals
for the trip, and I'd previously been mourning the fact that I didn't
have the luggage space to bring a copy home with me.  (The full game
includes two guitars and a drum set, and my suitcase was rather full.)
<p>
Lindsey's party was fantastic, and special shout-outs go to Kate and
Jeff, both of whom I spent much time talking to.  The saddest part
was it coming to a close, and me having heard the (now confirmed)
rumours that OSCON will be moving to San Jose for 2009.  It sucks having
made so many wonderful friends in Portland and not being able to come
back to Portland next year for OSCON, although I hope to find
other excuses to return.
<p>
At the end of the party Schwern is kind enough to give me a lift back
to my hotel.  The next day I sleep in, spend a little time sight-seeing,
and fly back to Australia.  My feet are sore, but I really don't want to
leave.
<p>
Lindsey, Kate, Stacy, Skud, Eric, Ricardo, Allison, Edd, Gina,
Tim, Jos, Andy, Matt, Perigrin, Jeff, r0ml, (and anyone I've missed),
and especially Shirley (our fantastic OSCON speaker liason), and
Schwern (who showed me around, let me borrow his bike, and generally
allowed me crash into his social circle), thank-you all
for a wonderful time, and an unforgettable trip.  I hope to see you
all again at OSCON 2009!

                <p><b>perl589delta needs your help!</b><br>
I've volunteered to write the release notes for the upcoming 5.8.9 release of Perl.  However I rapidly discovered there's an awful lot of changes that need to be examined and distilled into the final document that will become perl589delta.pod.
<p>
Luckily, this is a task that's easily broken into chunks and run in
parallel, and I've done exactly that.  I've got a copy of all the changes
that have gone into the 5.8 branch since 5.8.8 was released, and I've
chunked it by month.  Some months are quiet, with not many changes, and some
months are very busy, with lots of changes.
<p>
I'm making a call out to the Perl community to volunteer to help with the
writing of the release notes.  You don't need to be familiar with Perl's
guts to do this; if you don't understand a change we'll have a "too hard"
bucket that things can be thrown into, and someone (who may be me) will
figure them out.  Likewise, you don't need a lot of time; I'm not expecting
everyone who volunteers for a chunk of work to finish the entire chunk, just
as long as you work on it sequentially and let us know where you're up to,
you can put it down at any time.
<p>
Contributing to the perl589delta project directly helps with the release of
Perl 5.8.9.  However you'll also get a mention in the prestigious Perl
authors file, which looks totally awesome on your resume, and gives you
super bragging rights.  If you're on <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">ohloh</a>, you'll get kudos from me, and commit points from the project.  Your work will almost certainly give you enough material for a 5-minute "What's new in my bit of Perl 5.8.9" lightning talk, which will make you incredibly popular at conferences and user-groups.
<p>
In order to get started, just follow the instructions in the README file at
the bottom of our <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/perl589delta/">source control repository page</a> and sign up to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl589delta/">discussion list</a>.

                <p><b>Memoirs of an OSCON rockstar, Day 4 (Human Interfaces for Geeks)</b><br>
My sleeping pattern at OSCON remains sub-optimal.  I've crossed
timezones, and beause there are so many cool tings to do each
evening, <i>and</i> talk practicing and preparation, I find
myself going to bed late and sleeping in.  I <i>could</i>
push myself to wake up early, but being sleepy really wrecks
my speaking ability, and after my talk on failure, I've got
a reputation to maintain.
<p>
I wake up late in the morning, and receive what was the most exicting
e-mail I'd received in the entire conference.  It's from Allison
Randal:
<blockquote>
<i>Would you be willing to repeat "An Illustrated History of Failure"
[as a plenary]? It'd be 12:45pm Friday. </i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Woah!
<p>
At this point I should mention that presenting a plenary/keynote at
OSCON is one of my lifetime goals.  I thought that I'd gain a little
fame at 2008, a somewhat bigger audience in 2009, and then if I'm very
very lucky I could possibly be considered for a plenary/keynote in
2010.  I certainly didn't expect it at my first OSCON!  The only
lifetime goal I thought I would have had a chance of claiming at
OSCON was to play <a href="http://www.rockband.com/">Rock Band</a>.
<p>
Today I'm presenting "Human Interfaces for Geeks", aka "Hacking
Wetware for Fun and Profit", aka "Paul can't make up his mind
as to what this talk should be called".  My talk is essentially
about how people think, how to make them happy, and how
<i>making them happy causes them to do your bidding</i>.
<p>
When possible, I try to include conference-specific jokes in my
talks.  In my failure talk I managed to reference Rod::Logic and
Dr. Evil Conway.  Here, I figured that enough of my audience would
have gone to <i>People for Geeks</i>, so last night I had picked
Schwern as my victim.  Schwern had kindly provided me with some
pictures of him as a zombie, and I spent <i>way</i> too long last night creating
Schwern in The Sims 2, taking screenshots, turning him into a zombie,
and adding general zombie references.
<p>
I arrive at OSCON in time for lunch, rather sad that I've missed
some of the morning talks I was really looking forward to.  I'm also
stuck for where I should go after lunch; Anthony Baxter's running
the general lightning talks, and I <i>love</i> lightning talks.
Anthony runs the lightning talks at OSDC, and Linux.conf.au, and he
does a great job of keeping things moving and amusing.  I've got
stacks of lightning talks up my sleeve, so attending this should
have been a no-brainer.
<p>
However, Tim Bunce of DBI fame is giving a talk on
<i>Ultimate Perl Code Profiling</i>.  I'd spoken briefly to Tim
earlier in the week, and he told me new the profiler is awesomely
cool.  I know that I <i>could</i> learn it in my own time, but that
will probably take months before I get a round tuit, or I could just
attend Tim's talk and download it into my head in one go.
<p>
I attend Tim's talk.  It is awesome.  I know kung-fu.
<p>
I sneak out of Tim's talk during question time, because my
talk is next.  I find coffee and hurry to the room where I'm
presenting.
<p>
Amazingly, the talk goes down <i>extermely</i> well.  I seem to have
been gaining popularity over the conference, and now not only is the
room stuffed with people, but there's even a handheld video camera in
the audience!  It seems the audience wasn't disappointed, giving me
a 4.9/5.0 across 16 ratings!  Wow.
<p>
Next up are the Perl Lightning Talks.  I wasn't sure what to expect
from these, as I've seen lightning talks done really bad, but these
are just superb!  The Perl community has some great speakers, and
the talks are witty, informative, and well presented.  Of course, I
give one on <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/2008-08-20.html">autodie</a>, in case the conference hasn't heard enough
about it already.  ;)
<p>
The conference ends with Larry's "State of the Onion", and the Perl
Foundation Auction.  Unfortunately things run a little late, and
we lose a few too many audience members before the auction.  I pick
up a copy of Perl Medic (autographed, yay!), a few assorted other books,
and some cool YAPC drinking glasses.
<p>
With the main conference over, I head off to a rather exclusive
OSCON after-party.  Everyone at the party is famous.  <i>Everyone.</i> In fact,
as r0ml casually comments to me that his son wrote Twisted (python),
I realise that everyone <i>and their families</i> are famous.
<p>
The party was amazing, although I continue to make the odd faux pas:
"Oh, you use <a href="http://identi.ca/pjf/">identi.ca</a> too?", "No, I'm <a href="http://identi.ca/evan/">@evan</a>.  I <i>wrote</i> identi.ca."
Eventually I get used to the idea that if someone mentions a technology
I use, then not only did they write said technology, but they also
hold a Nobel Prize, played a role in the original Star Wars, and
psychically know what I want to drink next.
<p>
Eventually the party gets broken up.  It's probably the first time I've
ever been to a party so cool that it gets broken up rather than just peters out.  I head back to my hotel, discover I'm hungry, and go looking for food at 3am.  I find a Mexican place that gives me the most awesome burrito I've ever had in my life, but since I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, when I return there the next day I'm served something which is considerably less than awesome.
<p>
Eventually I get back to the hotel, set multiple alarms so I don't miss my talking slot, and sleep.
